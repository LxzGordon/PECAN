Pre-Release 2.5.1a0 (WIP)
--------------------------

- doc update (fix example of result plotter + improve doc)
- fixed logger issues when stdout lacks ``read`` function
- fixed a bug in ``common.dataset.Dataset`` where shuffling was not disabled properly (it affects only PPO1 with recurrent policies)
- fixed output layer name for DDPG q function, used in pop-art normalization and l2 regularization of the critic
- added support for multi env recording to ``generate_expert_traj`` (@XMaster96)
- added support for LSTM model recording to ``generate_expert_traj`` (@XMaster96)
- ``GAIL``: remove mandatory matplotlib dependency and refactor as subclass of ``TRPO`` (@kantneel and @AdamGleave)
- added ``get_attr()``, ``env_method()`` and ``set_attr()`` methods for all VecEnv. 
  Those methods now all accept ``indices`` keyword to select a subset of envs.
  ``set_attr`` now returns ``None`` rather than a list of ``None``.Â (@kantneel)
